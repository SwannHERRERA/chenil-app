# Reproduction

Breeding produces Eggs by putting two compatible Temtem together in the Breeding Center. Eggs may inherit various aspects of the parents such as their stats. Using certain items allows the player to manipulate this process. 

## Compatibility

Male and female Temtem need to share a type to breed

## Fertility

Fertility determines the number of times a tem can breed. The maximum fertility of tem is 8.
After production of an egg, the fertility value of the parents reduces by 1. The offspring will inherit the lowest fertility value among both parents after production of the egg.

## Inheritance

Various aspects of the parental Temtem are heritable, some of which depend on the use of items. 

**Species** - The offspring's species will be the same as the first form of the evolutionary line of the female parent. E.g. eggs produced by pairings with female Gazuma will hatch into Ganki.

**Fertility** - Offspring will inherit the lower value between the parents' fertility values after production of the egg. For example, if one parent had 8 fertility and the other had 6, after producing an egg their fertility will lower to 7 and 5 respectively, and the offspring will be born with 5 fertility as well.

**Single values** - Each of the offspring's stats have a 40% chance of inheriting the highest SV value between the parents, a 40% chance for the average (rounded up) and a 20% chance for the lower SV value. Breeding gear can be used to force certain stats of a parent to be inherited onto the offspring.

**Trait slot** - Traits are not inherited without the use of breeding gear. There is a 50% chance for each of both traits the offspring species can have. However, the Engineered DNA Strand will ensure inheritance of the trait slot as viewed in the Tempedia. E.g. a male Nessla with the Hydrologist trait (Nessla's second trait) paired with a female Gazuma will pass on the trait slot to the bred Ganki which gets the Cold-Natured trait (Ganki's second trait).

**Techniques** - Many species can inherit so-called egg techniques from other species. This is achieved by breeding with parents that have the respective techniques active, i.e. the four techniques that can be used in combat. Other techniques are not inherited and instead are learned by leveling or with use of training courses.

**Luma chance** - By default the chance of hatching a Luma Temtem is the same as encountering one in the wild, namely 1 in 10,000. For each Luma parent this chance increases x10, leading to odds of 1 in 1,000 for one Luma parent and 1 in 100 for two Luma parents.
